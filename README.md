### About Me

</div>

I am AndrÃ© Maio, currently a Master's student in the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Chemoinformatics+ program at NOVA School of Science and Technology and the UniversitÃ© de Strasbourg. My academic journey in chemistry began with a Bachelor's in Applied Chemistry from NOVA-FCT, which included an Erasmus+ exchange at the Universitat de Barcelona.

My primary interests are in organic synthesis, photochemistry, and chemoinformatics, with a passion for leveraging computational tools to solve challenging chemical problems. I have hands-on research experience in synthesizing and characterizing novel fluorescent dyes.

I am a proactive and detail-oriented individual with strong experience in project coordination and event management gained through leadership roles in national and international organizations. As president of the Applied Chemistry Students Association (NQA), I led a team of over 60 students. I have also held key roles in the National Chemistry Students Organisation (ANEQ) and the Board of European Students of Technology (BEST), where I organized international events for over 100 participants.

I am always eager to connect and explore opportunities in chemical research and data-driven science.
